# React Projects Practice Repository

### Welcome to my React Projects Practice Repository! This repository is dedicated to housing various React projects that I will be working on to enhance my skills and understanding of React.js.

**About**

This repository will serve as a collection of different React projects, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. Each project will be a standalone application focusing on different aspects of React development, including state management, hooks, context API, routing, and more.

**Projects**

Project 1: [Jokes Generator](projects/jokes-generator/jokegenerator)

Description: we will create a website that retrieves jokes from an external API and displays them on the screen.


Project 2: [Rolling dice](projects/rolling-dice)

Description: This rolling dice project is a React application that simulates rolling two dice. Users click a button to "roll" the dice, which triggers a visual change and displays random dice faces, enhancing the experience with a rolling animation. The project showcases basic React component structure and state management using hooks.

Project 3: [Accordian](projects/accordion)

 Description :This project is a React-based accordion component that allows users to interact with expandable and collapsible sections. Each section displays a question, and when clicked, it reveals the corresponding answer. The component supports both single and multiple item selection modes. In single selection mode, only one section can be expanded at a time. In multiple selection mode, users can expand multiple sections simultaneously. A button toggles between these modes. The component uses state management to track the currently selected sections and applies conditional rendering to display the content dynamically.

Project 4: [Random Color](projects/random-color)

 Description :This React component generates random colors in either HEX or RGB format. Users can switch between color types and generate new random colors with button clicks.

 Project 5: [Star Rating](projects/star-rating)

 Description :The StarRating component renders a series of star icons based on the noOfStars prop. Users can click on stars to set the rating, and the component provides visual feedback by highlighting stars as the mouse hovers over them. The styling of the active and inactive stars is defined in the imported style.css file.
