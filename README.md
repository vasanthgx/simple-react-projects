# React Projects Practice Repository

### Welcome to my React Projects Practice Repository! This repository is dedicated to housing various React projects that I will be working on to enhance my skills and understanding of React.js.

**About**

This repository will serve as a collection of different React projects, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. Each project will be a standalone application focusing on different aspects of React development, including state management, hooks, context API, routing, and more.

**Projects**

Project 1: [Jokes Generator](projects/jokes-generator/jokegenerator)

Description: we will create a website that retrieves jokes from an external API and displays them on the screen.


Project 2: [Rolling dice](projects/rolling-dice)

Description: This rolling dice project is a React application that simulates rolling two dice. Users click a button to "roll" the dice, which triggers a visual change and displays random dice faces, enhancing the experience with a rolling animation. The project showcases basic React component structure and state management using hooks.
